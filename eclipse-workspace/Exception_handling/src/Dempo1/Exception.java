		 //Error is situation which prevent this normal of occur program 
		/*generally three types of error 
		    1.syntax error - it is grammatical error while writing a program 
		    					eg. missing semicolon,Incorrect format in selection & loop initialization
		    
		    2.Runtime error - when program with no syntax error , this error occur in the run mode of program  
		    					eg. typing to divided by a zero , trying to open a file that does not exist

		  Exception :- It is a event which occur during execution of program that interrupts the normal flow of program 
		   All the exception usually handle by java compiler ,exception occur java provide an error message and terminate the program
		   but, problem is the error message displayed by java is not so easy to understand for end user
		     to solve this problem ,programmer has explicitly handle the exception
		      
		      			In Exception  we have two types
		      			 1.Checked :-Occurs at the time of program compilation ,also known as compile time exception
		      			 
		      			 
		      			 2.Unchecked:- that are not checked at compile time 
		      			 
		      	Exception handling Keyword:-
		      			1.try
		      			2.catch
		      			3.finally
		      			4.throw
		      			5.throws
